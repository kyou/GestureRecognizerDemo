// after this is received all remaining active touches will be ignored (no further updates will be received for touches that had already begun but haven't ended)

// UIGestureRecognizers aren't in the responder chain, but observe touches hit-tested to their view and their view's subviews
// UIGestureRecognizers receive touches before the view to which the touch was hit-tested
